# emoTone

Final project for module 3 at Access Labs by [Diana J. Yoo](https://github.com/dianajyoo) and [Bijon Miles](https://github.com/BijonMiles).

emoTone is based on natural language processing, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand and interpret human language. With the help of IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API, emoTone analyzes emotion and tone behind written text. Can predict whether text is happy, sad, afraid, worried, and more. Supports speech to text input in addition to manual text input.

This the the backend and the frontend with instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/dianajyoo/emoTone-frontend).
